# Thesis Work
All code in this repository was written by David Langbehn in completion of my Master's Thesis, "Privacy-Preserving Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks".

This repository is split into two different compilation implementations, one utilizing Cmake and the other utilizing g++ and a command line interface for setting hyperparameters. The g++ implementation is the final version used in completion of my thesis and includes secure CNNs for evaluation on both the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
